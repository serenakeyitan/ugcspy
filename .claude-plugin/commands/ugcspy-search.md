description: Find competitor UGC on TikTok — third-party creators promoting a brand, or a brand's own posts

You are running `ugcspy search` for the user. The CLI binary is `ugcspy` on PATH.

User arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

Run via the Bash tool:

```bash
ugcspy search $ARGUMENTS
```

## Three search modes (two auto-detected from query prefix, one explicit)

- **Plain word** (e.g. `liquiddeath`, `glossier`, `notion`) → **hashtag mode**: finds third-party creators promoting the brand. This is the BigSpy-for-UGC default — most users want this.
- **`@handle`** (e.g. `@glossier`) → **user mode**: pulls the brand's OWN posts.
- **`#tag`** → explicit hashtag mode.
- **`--mode keyword "<topic phrase>"`** (never auto-detected) → **keyword mode**: broad niche/topic discovery, NOT limited to videos tagging a brand. Pure HTTP, works with zero setup.
- **`--mode user|hashtag|keyword`** flag overrides auto-detection.

When a user says "what's working for [brand] on TikTok" or "find creators promoting [brand]", default to hashtag mode (no prefix). When they say "what is [brand] posting", that's user mode (`@brand`). When they want a topic/niche corpus with no brand tag ("find skincare routine UGC"), that's `--mode keyword "skincare routine"`.

## Output

If the user did not pass `--json`, the CLI prints a formatted table with brand hashtags highlighted, plus a summary of the most prolific creators when in hashtag mode. Relay the table as-is (it's already formatted).

If they passed `--json`, parse the array and summarize the top 5 in a markdown table. Each row has an `id` field.

## After showing results — offer the natural next steps

Once results are visible, ask the user a one-liner like:

> Want me to:
> - **Fork** one of these into a quick creator brief (hook + beat sheet)? → `/ugcspy-fork <id>`
> - **Recipe** one of these — reverse-engineer it into a reproducible structure with per-clip prompts, cuts, hook pattern, voiceover (heavier, takes a few minutes, useful if it's an AI-generated video you want to replicate)? → `/ugcspy-recipe <id>`

Don't force the question if the user clearly only wanted the list. But if they showed interest in one specific row ("this one looks interesting", "wow #1 has 335K views"), proactively offer both options for that row.

`/ugcspy-fork` is the right answer for a human-shot creator video (lighter, brief-shaped output). `/ugcspy-recipe` is the right answer for AI-generated videos (heavier, recipe.json + per-clip generation prompts).

## Defaults

- Sort: `views` (highest reach first — BigSpy-style)
- Window: last 30 days
- Platform: `all` (the standalone CLI tries TikTok and Instagram; tiktok-oss only supports TikTok so it'll cleanly skip IG)

## Wall time

Hashtag-mode first-run on an active brand takes a few minutes (~5-8 min for a brand with ~150 discovered creators): browser-free discovery (enumerate every brand hashtag + follow-graph snowball over the tikwm relay) followed by a yt-dlp coverage walk of each discovered creator's full catalog (16-way concurrent by default, `UGCSPY_WALK_CONCURRENCY`) — the walk dominates. Tell the user this BEFORE invoking. User-mode (`@brand`) is much faster (~10-20s, single fetch).

Subsequent searches on the same brand serve from cache instantly. Use `--refresh` for a fresh fetch.

## Setup errors

If the user gets `tiktok-oss: TikTokApi not installed`, suggest `ugcspy install-deps`.

Hashtag mode is browser-free (HTTP via the tikwm relay), so it doesn't need `MS_TOKEN`. If discovery returns few or zero candidates on a brand you'd expect to have UGC, tikwm is likely throttling — wait a bit and retry, and/or raise `UGCSPY_HASHTAG_FEED_DELAY` to widen the gap between feed reads. `MS_TOKEN` only matters for the optional Chromium/TikTokApi fallbacks (`UGCSPY_USE_CHROMIUM=1`); keyword mode is pure HTTP and ignores it — see README troubleshooting.
